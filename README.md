# Project-Wilder

This website was a collaboration between Shawn Rather (Back End Developer (JS)), Michael McCosh (Front End Developer - UX/UI), and Nicole Kleinmann (Team Lead/Communication).  We had specific roles, but also helped eachother out frequently throughout the development process. This website is designed for anyone who likes space. We used three APIs; [NASA's APOD (astronomy photo of the day)](https://api.nasa.gov/), [NASA's Mars Rover](ttps://api.nasa.gov/) and [SpaceX API](http://hubblesite.org/api/documentation).

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS and CSS Framework: Materialize, JavaScript jQuery
New Third-Party API: particles.js
Server-Side APIs: NASA APIs and Space X API

Parts of Website: 
1. User is presented with Search Results when website is open.
2. User can select to choose between the Astronomy, Mars, and SpaceX category to view photos. 
3. When astronomy is selected, user will be asked to enter a date.
4. When SpaceX or Mars is selected, user will see arrow buttons to view available photos.
5. When Search is clicked, photo(s) and description(s) for relevent images will appear on screen.
6. User can save photos to their personal collection using local storage.
7. When user clicks collection button, user has the ability to view all images saved in collection by selecting the arrow buttons and the number of photos in collection is displayed.
8. User can delete a photo from their personal collection.
9. User can switch between Search Results and Collection page. 


Challenges: 

This was our first group project. We learned how to deal with merge conflicts and how to problem solve and debug as a team.  Being able to store images from both APIs into the same array of objects took some time. Once we were able to do this, then we were able to store this array of objects into local storage to make our collection page possible.
